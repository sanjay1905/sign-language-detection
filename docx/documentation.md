Fig 3.2 Hand mapping
These key points will be fed into a pre-trained gesture recognizer network to recognize the hand pose.
Steps to solve the project:
•	Import necessary packages.
•	Initialize models.
•	Read frames from a webcam.
•	Detect hand keypoints.
•	Recognize hand gestures.
Step 1 – Import necessary packages
To build this Hand Gesture Recognition project, we’ll need four packages. So first import these.
Step 2 – Initialize models
Mp.solution.hands module performs the hand recognition algorithm. So we create the object and store it in mpHands. Using mp Hands.Hands method we configured the model. The first argument is max_num_hands, that means the maximum number of hand will be detected by the model in a single frame. MediaPipe can detect multiple hands in a single frame, but we’ll detect only one hand at a time in this project. Mp.solutions.drawing_utils will draw the detected key points for us so that we don’t have to draw them manually.
Initialize Tensorflow
Using the load_model function we load the TensorFlow pre-trained model.
Gesture.names file contains the name of the gesture classes. So first we open the file using python’s inbuilt open function and then read the file.
After that, we read the file using the read() function.
Output :
[‘okay’, ‘peace’, ‘thumbs up’, ’no hand detection’, ‘open hand’]
The model can recognize 5 different gestures.
Step 3 – Read frames from a webcam:
We create a VideoCapture object and pass an argument ‘0’. It is the camera ID of the system. In this case, we have 1 webcam connected with the system. If you have multiple webcams then change the argument according to your camera ID. Otherwise, leave it default.
The cap.read() function reads each frame from the webcam.
cv2.flip() function flips the frame.
cv2.imshow() shows frame on a new openCV window.
The cv2.waitKey() function keeps the window open until the key ‘q’ is pressed
Step 4 – Detect hand keypoints:
MediaPipe works with RGB images but OpenCV reads images in BGR format. So, using cv2.cvtCOLOR() function we convert the frame to RGB format.The process function takes an RGB frame and returns a result class.Then we check if any hand is detected or not, using result.multi_hand_landmarks method.After that, we loop through each detection and store the coordinate on a list called landmarks. Here image height (y) and image width(x) are multiplied with the result because the model returns a normalized result. This means each value in the result is between 0 and 1.And finally using mpDraw.draw_landmarks() function we draw all the landmarks in the frame.
Step 5 – Recognize hand gestures:
The model.predict() function takes a list of landmarks and returns an array contains 10 prediction classes for each landmark.The output looks like thisNp.argmax() returns the index of the maximum value in the list.After getting the index we can simply take the class name from the classNames list.Then using the cv2.putText function we show the detected gesture into the frame.

MODULE DESCRIPTION
4.1	Data Collection:
This involves creating a dataset for sign language detection. It could involve capturing images or videos of different sign language gestures. The data can be collected from a live feed from a video cam and every frame that detects a hand in the region of interest (ROI) can be saved in a directory
4.2	Preprocessing: 
This step involves preparing the data for the model. It could involve resizing images, normalizing pixel values, segmenting the hand region, and more
4.3	Feature Extraction: 
This module is responsible for extracting relevant features from the preprocessed data. These 	features are then used by the model to learn the patterns associated with different signs
4.4Model Training: 
This involves training a machine learning or deep learning model on the extracted features. The model could be a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN),or any other suitable model
4.5	Prediction:  This module uses the trained model to predict the sign language gestures in new, unseen data
4.6	Post-processing:  This step involves interpreting the model’s predictions and converting them into
understandable outputs

4.7 SYSTEM ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
System Analysis and Design, is the process of gathering and interpreting facts, diagnosing problem and using the information to recommend improvement to the system.  Before development of any project can be pursued, a system study is conducted to learn the details of the current business solution.  Information gathered through the study forms the basis for creating alternative design strategies.  Virtually all organizations are systems that interact with their environment through receiving input and producing output. It is a management technique used in designing a new system, improving an existing system or solving problem.  System analysis does not guarantee that the user will derive an ideal solution to a problem.  This depends solely on the way one design a system to exploit the potential in the method.  To put it in another way, creativity is as much as must pre-design the study and problem solving process and evaluate every successive step in the system analysis.Taking all these factors into account and with the knowledge of the inter-relationship between the various fields and section and their potential interactions, they are consider for developing the whole system in and integrated manner, this project is developed to meet all the criteria in the The management technique is also helps us in develop and design of the new system or to improve the existing system.
The following Objectives are kept in mind:
•	Identify the customer’s need.
•	Evaluate the system concept for feasibility.
•	Perform economic and technical analysis.
•	Allocate functions to hardware, software, people, database and other system elements.
•	Establish cost and schedule constraints
•	Create a system definition that forms the foundation for all subsequent engineering work.
Identification of the need:
In this, there are certain expressions that are being used in the development of the project.  And, it is used to identify our needs or source in the project.
•	Defining a problem
•	Finding the various need for the problem
•	Formalizing the need
•	Relating the need 
Thus, it is the first step for system development life cycle.
Initial Investigation
It is one way of handling the project, it is used to know about the user request and the modification of the system should be done.
The user’s request for this project is as follows:	
1.	Assigning separate work area for different users.
2.	Nature of the work 
3.	Regular update and delete of record
4.	Regular calculation of Net Asset Value
5.	Supplying the data with the time required.

The user request identifies the need for change and authorizes the initial investigation.  It may undergo several modifications before it become a written commitment.  Once approved the activities are carried out into action.  The proposal, when approved, it initiates a detailed user-oriented specification of system performance and analysis of the feasibility of the evaluating alternative candidate systems with a recommendation of the best system for the job.
 
4.8 Feasibility Study
The objective of the feasibility study is not only to solve the problem but also to acquire a sense of its scope.  The reason for doing this is to identify the most beneficial project to the organization. 
	There are three aspects in the feasibility study:
1.	Technical Feasibility
2.	Financial Feasibility
3.	Operating Feasibility
Technical Feasibility
The Technical feasibility is the study of the software and how it is included in the study of our project.  Regarding this there are some technical issues that should be noted they are as follows:

•	Is the necessary technique available and how it is suggested and acquired?
•	Does the proposed equipment have the technical capacity to hold the data required using the new system?
•	Will the system provide adequate response that is made by the requester at an periodic time interval
•	Can this system be expanded after this project development
•	Is there a technique guarantees of accuracy, reliability in case of access of data and security
The technical issues are raised during the feasibility study of investigating our System.  Thus, the technical consideration evaluates the hardware requirements, software etc.  This system uses JSP as front end and Oracle as back end.  They also provide sufficient memory to hold and process the data.  As the company is going to install all the process in the system it is the cheap and efficient technique.
This system technique accepts the entire request made by the user and the response is done without failure and delay.  It is a study about the resources available and how they are achieved as an acceptable system.  It is an essential process for analysis and definition of conducting a parallel assessment of technical feasibility.

Though storage and retrieval of information is enormous, it can be easily handled by Oracle. As the oracle can be run in any system and the operation does not differ from one to another.  So, this is effective.
Economical Feasibility
An organization makes good investment on the system. So, they should be worthful for the amount they spend in the system. Always the financial benefit and equals or less the cost of the system, but should not exceed the cost.  
•	The cost of investment is analyzed for the entire system
•	The cost of Hardware and Software is also noted.
•	Analyzing the way in which the cost can be reduced
Every organization want to reduce there cost but at the same time quality of the Service should also be maintained. The system is developed according the estimation of the cost made by the concern.  In this project, the proposed system will definitely reduce the cost and also the manual work is reduced and speed of work is also increased.
Operational Feasibility
Proposed project will be beneficial only when they are turned into an information system and to meet the organization operating requirements. The following issues are considered for the operation:
•	Does this system provide sufficient support for the user and the management?
•	What is the method that should be used in this project?
•	Have the users been involved in the planning and development of the projects?
•	Will the proposed system cause any harm, bad result, loss of control and accessibility of the system will lost?
Issues that may be a minor problem will sometimes cause major problem in the operation. It is the measure of how people can able to work with the system.  Finding out the minor issues that may be the initial problem of the system.  It should be a user-friendly environment. All these aspect should be kept in mind and steps should be taken for developing the project carefully.
Regarding the project, the system is very much supported and friendly for the user. The methods are defined in an effective manner and proper conditions are given in other to avoid the harm or loss of data.  It is designed in GUI interface, as working will be easier and flexible for the user. They are three basic feasibility studies that are done in every project.
USE CASE DIAGRAM
A use case diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of behavioral diagram defined by and created from a Use-case analysis. Its purpose is to present a graphical overview of the functionality provided by a system in terms of actors, their goals (represented as use cases), and any dependencies between those use cases. The main purpose of a use case diagram is to show what system functions are performed for which actor. Roles of the actors in the system can be depicted.
